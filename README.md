- 👋 Hi, I’m @razamu15
- 👀 I’m interested in making things that I can be proud of. I love thinking about systems on a big scale 
  and how to engineer solutions that need to meet size, scale and speed requirements.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Apache Kakfka and how to work with real-time date streams using it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything new that piques my interest
- 📫 How to reach me: m.saad.raza1999@gmail.com
